## :wave: Hello

The current webpage serves as the installation package for Automock. To use Automock, it is necessary to install the
requisite target libraries of your choice, such as
`@automock/jest` or `@automock/sinon`.

## :question: What is Automock?

**Automock is a TypeScript-based library designed for unit testing applications.**

By leveraging the TypeScript Reflection API (`reflect-metadata`) under the hood, Automock simplifies the process of
writing tests by automatically generating mock objects for a class's dependencies.

You can also browse more information and read
documentation [at the following link](https://github.com/omermorad/automock), in Automock main homepage.

## Installation

Automock simplifies installation by using `npx`. Execute the following command to initiate the process:

```bash
npx automock init
```
