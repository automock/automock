### [‚ÜóÔ∏è Documentation](https://automock.dev/docs) &nbsp;&nbsp; [‚ÜóÔ∏è API Reference](https://automock.dev/api-reference) &nbsp;&nbsp; [‚ÜóÔ∏è Example](https://automock.dev/docs/getting-started/examples)

**Automock streamlines the unit testing process by auto-generating mock objects for class dependencies within
dependency injection environments. With compatibility across various DI and testing frameworks, Automock allows you
to focus on crafting test cases instead of manual mock configurations, enhancing your unit testing journey.**

## Automock's Core Features

üöÄ **Zero-Setup Mocking** - Dive straight into testing without the hassle. Automatically generate mock
objects, eliminate manual setup, and reduce boilerplate code.

üîç **Type-Safe Mocks** - Leverage TypeScript's power with mocks that retain the same type information as real objects.
Write tests with confidence, knowing that type mismatches will be caught.

üîÑ **Consistent Test Architecture** - Achieve a uniform approach to unit testing.
Your tests will follow a consistent syntax and structure, making them easier to read and maintain.

üìà **Optimized Performance** - By bypassing the DI container load, Automock's design ensures your unit tests run 
significantly faster. This lets you focus on development without unnecessary waits.

üåê **Community & Support** - Join a growing community of developers. Regular updates, comprehensive
documentation, and responsive support to ensure you get the most out of Automock.

## :package: Installation

To fully integrate Automock into your testing and dependency injection framework, **you need to install two
packages: `@automock/jest`, and the corresponding DI framework adapter.**

1. Install Automock's Jest package:
```bash
$ npm i -D @automock/jest
````

2. And for your DI framework, install the appropriate Automock adapter (as a dev dependency):

| DI Framework | Package Name                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| NestJS       | `@automock/adapters.nestjs`    |
| Inversify    | `@automock/adapters.inversify` |

For example:
```bash
$ npm i -D @automock/jest @automock/adapters.nestjs
```

No further configuration is required.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Migrating from v1.x to v2.0

The NestJS adapter came pre-bundled in v1.x. In v2.0, you'll need to install it manually:

```bash
$ npm i -D @automock/adapters.nestjs
```

> For a detailed list of changes read Automock's [v2.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/automock/automock/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

That's about it. :smile_cat:

## :computer: Quick Example

Take a look at the following example:

Consider the following `UserService` class:
```typescript
export class Database {
  async getUsers(): Promise<User[]> { ... }
}

export class UserService {
  constructor(private database: Database) {}

  async getAllUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
    return this.database.getUsers();
  }
}
```

Let's create a unit test for this class:

```typescript
import { TestBed } from '@automock/jest';
import { Database, UserService } from './user.service'; 

describe('User Service Unit Spec', () => {
  let userService: UserService;
  let database: jest.Mocked<Database>;

  beforeAll(() => {
    const { unit, unitRef } = TestBed.create(UserService).compile();
    userService = unit;
    database = unitRef.get(Database);
  });

  test('should return users from the database', async () => {
    const mockUsers: User[] = [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }];
    database.getUsers.mockResolvedValue(mockUsers);

    const users = await userService.getAllUsers();

    expect(database.getUsers).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(users).toEqual(mockUsers);
  });
});
```

In this example, Automock streamlines the process of creating mock objects and stubs for the `Database` dependency.
With the use of the `TestBed`, an instance of the `UserService` class can be created with mock objects automatically
generated for its dependencies.

During the test, we have direct access to the automatically generated mock object for the `Database` dependency (database).
By stubbing the `getUsers()` method of the database mock object, we can define its behavior and make sure it resolves with
a specific set of mock users.
